<p class="four"> As women, we are often told what we can and cannot do. We often get the shorter
  end of the stick. Growing up, I was always told that I need to take care of my younger brother because
  I am the older child, the more responsible one. I would have to take on all the responsibilities, yet I am
  not as free as my sibling. Because I am female, I was told by my parents that i'm not allowed to attend parties. I
  was told I cannot major in computer science because not many females are in that field. Instead, my father told
  that I needed to major in Business and so I did.</p>
  <br>
  <p class="four">At my first job, for the same position, I was paid fairly less than my male coworkers.
We went to the same college, have the same degree, but yet I was paid less. No matter how much better my performance
was, I still got paid less but that didn't stop me from doing my best at work. To make myself more distintive from
my make other coworkers. I took extra classes related to the field of work I was doing and read cases and files pertaining
to housing. This helped me to be more knowledgeble about the field and be more efficient in what I did. Eventhough
I had to do the extra work to gain the equal pay, it was a start.As women we often times need to work harder than
our male peers. But, do not give up, you have it within you to strive. </p>
